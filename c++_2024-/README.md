# welcome to the somewhat most recent wasteladns

Workshop to explore different aspects of gamedev. DX and GL on windows, GL on mac.

CMake should let you configure the build for your environment of choice. You can edit "COMPILE_TARGET" inside src/main.cpp to alternate between the different tests.
Alternatively, you can run build.bat (on Windows) or build.sh (on Mac) to build the test specified by "COMPILE_TARGET" inside src/main.cpp.

Please let me know if it doesn't just build out of the box.

## Current tests

[Planar Mirror Test](src/TestMirrors/README.md) - a silly study of recursive mirrored cameras
